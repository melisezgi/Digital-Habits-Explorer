# Digital-Habits-Explorer
This project analyzes personal screen time data to uncover insights into daily smartphone usage patterns.
# Screen Time Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes my screen time data to understand my daily usage habits and trends. By studying how I spend time on my phone, I aim to identify opportunities to improve productivity and reduce distractions.

## Dataset Description
The data was collected from my smartphone's built-in screen time tracker. It includes daily usage data categorized by apps, total screen time, and usage times across different days.

## Project Plan
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
- Summarize the total screen time and app usage across the week.
- Identify patterns, such as peak usage times and differences between app categories.
- Compare weekday and weekend usage to spot behavioral shifts.
2. **Visualization**:
- Create charts for screen time distribution and app usage trends.
3. **Findings**:
- Summarize insights, such as the most-used apps or categories and areas for improvement.
4. **Future Work**:
- Explore predictive modeling to estimate future screen time trends.
- Develop strategies to improve productivity and reduce distractions.

## Deliverables
The repository will include:

 - Analysis Scripts:
Python scripts for data cleaning, EDA, and visualization.
 - Visualizations:
Charts and summaries of screen time trends and app usage.
 - README.md:
A detailed explanation of the project, including its goals, methodology, and findings.
 - GitHub Repository:
All project materials, excluding raw data for privacy.

## Timeline
- Project repository setup: Completed by Nov 30.
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Initial Findings: December 2024.
- Final analysis and findings: To be submitted by Jan 10.

## Limitations
This analysis is based on personal data, so insights may not generalize to others. The dataset may also have incomplete records due to phone inactivity on some days.
