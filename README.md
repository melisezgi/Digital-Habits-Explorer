This project analyzes personal screen time data to uncover insights into daily smartphone usage patterns.
# Screen Time Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes my screen time data to understand my daily usage habits and trends. By studying how I spend time on my phone, I aim to identify opportunities to improve productivity and reduce distractions.

## Dataset Description
The data was collected from my smartphone's built-in screen time tracker. It includes daily usage data categorized by apps, total screen time, and usage times across different days.

## Project Plan
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze total screen time trends (weekdays vs. weekends).
   - Identify the most-used apps and categories (e.g., social media, work, entertainment).
2. **Visualization**:
   - Create charts for screen time distribution and app usage trends.
3. **Findings**:
   - Summarize the key insights about my habits.
4. **Future Work**:
   - Explore methods to reduce unnecessary screen time.

## Deliverables
- A detailed report with visualizations and analysis scripts.
- GitHub repository with all scripts (no raw data for privacy).

## Timeline
- Project repository setup: Completed by Nov 30.
- Final analysis and findings: To be submitted by Jan 10.

## Limitations
This analysis is based on personal data, so insights may not generalize to others. The dataset may also have incomplete records due to phone inactivity on some days.
